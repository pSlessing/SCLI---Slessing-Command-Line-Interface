This is a small project to make my life easier and less annoying during University!

Currently, it simply opens my books and courses for different courses, and some resources for the semester project, as well as play music on TIDAL, but I'll slowly chip away at more features!
(Also i will probably learn markdown at some point, but uhh, we'll get to it when we do)
